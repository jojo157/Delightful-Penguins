### Skeleton

#### Wireframes

Wireframes for this project were created using Balsamiq and can be viewed at below link.

Link to [Wireframe]()

#### Database Design

This application uses Heroku Postgres to store and retrieve the user data. Postgres is an object-relational database system. This application consists of 7 collections as shown in the schema below.

The users collection is populated when a user successfully registers and is used to verify a user upon login. The Art collection stores the data for the art pieces that appear on the home page. Only a user with staff status can add/edit this collection.

The Messages collection stores the data for any user that engages with the chat functionality present on all pages. The users IP address is added to each message and when removed from the session the assoicated messages are deleted. When the artist replies to a message the IP address of the recieved message is used and the reply recieved field is updated to true.

The Artist collection stores the artist's available status for the chat functionality. This can be updated with a switch on the Messages page by the Artist. 

The Contact collection is used for when the chat facility is not active and the user completes the contact form.

The Order Collection stores the order details when a customer completes checkout. For each order there may be several orderline items, this collection stores data associated with individual cart items and the associated order number.

### Surface

Leticias Art was designed to be a fun, colorful application to sell art. 

#### Colour Scheme
To reinforce the colourful aspect of art, multiple colours were used throughout the application. The navbar is a gradient of the rainbow colours with a bold purple on the footer. Complimentary colours are used throughout the site to prevent colours clashing. A golden yellow is used on the message alerts and on the footer for the chat functionality. 


#### Typography
Fonts used are Helvetica, Arial and sans-serif. This font was used for clear legibility of text throughout the application. 

## Testing

A summary of testing conducted is shown in the table below. 

![Testing Summary](media/readme/testSummary.png)

### Code Validation

#### Html

Html pages were validated with [W3C Html Checker](https://validator.w3.org/nu/). To obtain the HTML code on live pages, the safari developer tools were used to open the page source html and this was copied and pasted into the text input field on W3C for validation. Pages Sign Up, Login, Checkout Success, Add Art, Art Edit and 404 had no errors or warnings on validation.

##### Landing Page

Errors 
- Element p not allowed as child of element small in this context.
  - This error was present as I had a small element as a parent with a p element as a child. I fixed this error by swaping the roles.
- Unclosed element div.
  - I located the element and closed the corresponding div tag.

##### Cart

The cart page was tested firstly with no items in the cart. Then by adding two items and rechecking the html on Html Checker.

Errors 
- Unclosed element div.
  - This error was due to placing a conditional template literal after the opening of a div, then when condition was false there was only an open div tag. I fixed this by placing the template literal before the opening of the div. 

##### Checkout

Errors
- Duplicate ID submit-button.
  - I had not noticed I had used the same ID on the chat submit button and the checkout submit button. I updated the checkout-button ID to submit-button2 and amended any related files using this value.

##### Orders

Errors 
- Unclosed element div.
  - This error was due to a closing div been outside of a conditional block of html. It was fixed by relocating the closing div within the conditional block.

##### Artist Messages

Errors
- End tag h3 seen, but there were open elements.
  - The above error was due to changing a h3 element to a h5 element and forgetting to change the closing tag. This was updated to ensure both tags have h5.

##### Reply

Errors
- Duplicate IDs
  - Some of the ids for the chat window were also used for the artist reply chat window. I updated the IDs for the artist chat page to remove the duplication.

##### Contact

Errors
- Unclosed element div.
  - I forgot to close the container div. I fixed this an retested. 

##### Art Details

Errors 
- Element p not allowed as child of element small in this context.
  - This error was present as I had a small element as a parent with a p element as a child. I fixed this error by swaping the roles.


All pages now successfully pass through the validator as shown in the image below.

![HTML success on all pages](media/readme/htmlSuccess.png)


#### CSS

CSS page was validated with [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

No errors were present.

![css pass ](media/readme/cssSuccess.png)

#### JavaScript

JavaScript files were validated with [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)

The were several warnings as shown below for missing semi-colons, undefined variables and a warning that it is better to use dot notation instead of format ['x']. I fixed the missing semi-colons, defined the variables and updated the notation to dot notion. The code was retested and no warnings are given now.

![Warnings for Chat Messages](media/readme/chatMessageJS.png)

#### Python

All Python files were validated with [PEP8 online](http://pep8online.com)

The following errors were discovered and fixed to stay PEP8 compliant:
- E302 expected 2 blank line, found 1.
- E713 test for membership should be 'not in'
  - I had a conditional check where the statement was "if not x in y". I fixed the syntax as advised.
- E501 line too long 
  - This occured where my function docstring was longer than 79 characters. I pushed the sentence to the next sentence to stay compliant. 
- E225 missing whitespace around operator
  - This error was due to forgetting to put a whitespace on an assignment operator. 

Errors rectified and files are PEP8 compliant now.

### Performance Testing

Performance was tested using Lighthouse, one of Google's web developer tools. To improve the SEO of the app, I added a meta description. 

For the Landing Page, the best practices score was 93% due to the hero image been displayed with the incorrect aspect ratio for larger devices. I changed the CSS to preserve the aspect ratio of the images using object-fit and object-position properities. This resulted in the best practices score increasing to 100% and improved the layout for user experience.

example output from Lighthouse audit for Landing Page.

The final results for each page are shown in the below table.
